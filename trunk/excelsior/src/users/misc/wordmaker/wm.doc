                    Overview of WordMaker.

    Design of WordMaker text processing system was begun in 1984.
The  goal was to create a portable multi-language word processor.
First  implementation  of  this  system  (called WordMaker 1) for
CP/M-80 is currently used in various places of Estonia. Next step
in  microcomputer word processing technology, WordMaker 2 is more
powerful and more WordStar-compatible. The version of this system
for Exelsior II has the  following facilities:

    **  Multi-language  support: full 8-bit code is avalaible for
characters. Up to three fonts can be displayed simultaneously.

    ** Video editing: text part of the screen looks like a window
to  the  file  being  edited.  Move  by  column,  word,  line, to
begin/end of line, screen, file; Scroll by line or screen; Delete
current/  previous  character, word right, delete to begin/end of
line,   current   line;   insert  line;  insert/overwrite  modes;
concatenate lines. Cursor can be moved after logical end of line.
All changes are immediately displayed;

    **  Help  system:  list  of  available  commands  can be seen
simultaneously  with  text  being edited; Display of menus can be
switched off.

    ** Undo: restore current line; recall last deleted line.

    **  Block  operations:  sequence  of  lines  can be marked as
block; Block can be copied, moved, deleted, written to disk.

    **  Find/Replace:  find ignoring case; find whole words only;
global  find/replace;  find/replace backwards; display only lines
matched with find pattern.

    **  Horizontal  rolling:  for  long  lines,  screen  is moved
horizontally  if user attemps to move out of it. Line can contain
up to 255 characters.

    **  Word  wrap:  during  text  entry  there is no need to use
RETURN  key: line is formatted and new line is inserted automati-
cally; indent mode is available.

    **   Formatting:  from  current  line  to  end  of  paragraph
(paragraph  is  sequence of lines ending with CTRL-F); justify to
right margin; center text between margins.

    **  Hyphenation:  words  are  hyphenated automatically during
reformat.  For irregular words, hyphenation places can be defined
by  entering CTRL-_ controls into word. Hyphenation of particular
word  can  be  disabled  by entering CTRL-_ as first character in
word. Soft hyphenation can be switched off.

    **  Markers:  up to ten places in text are remembered. Cursor
can be returned to its previous place.

    ** File and directory operations: display directory; display,
read, delete another file.

    **  Text  printing:  a  separate  program called WordPrint is
available.  WordPrint  reads  printer  description  from  printer
definition  file. A number of print controls and dot commands can
be  used  in  text  to  be printed; Selective page/line printing;
printable  files  can  contain  references  to another files (.FI
command); multiple copy printing.
